<p>So we have one massive wall of text to read through.<br>
Trying to find a pattern or code inside this much text is normally difficult, but did you notice something about the ingredients?<br>
</p><div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Hint">Hint</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;"><br>
Ever heard of ‚Äú5/4 Tablespoons‚Äù or ‚Äú3/7 Teaspoons‚Äù of something? Look at just the numbers üòâ<br>
</div></div>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Solution">Solution</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;"><br>
Since the first couple of numbers look like they can be in the range of Decimal characters, extract all the numbers from the text, keeping them in the same order as they appear.
<p>(Seems like a daunting task, but a little hint: ‚ÄúAbuse‚Äù the tools you have and their features.<br>
<a href="http://multidec.web-lab.at/nc.php" target="_blank">Multi-DEC Number converter</a> will filter out only the numbers, leaving you with a nice string of only the numbers in the text.<br>
<code>548167855673788669787382738451825285</code><br>
Group them into pairs<br>

<p><code>Good for 9 Portions<br>

<p><code>Wash and cut all the ingredients and serve in a bowl. Season with 4 Tb of olive oil and some salt.</code></p>
<p>Numbers for the ingredients are not like the previous one, so we‚Äôll need to identify another way.<br>
</p><div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Hint">Hint</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;"><br>
Instead of reading ‚ÄúIngredients‚Äù, read ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù and take a look where how many numbers appear.<br>
</div></div>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Solution">Solution</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;"><br>
Using the number in front of each ingredient as an index, write down the character that appears at that index.<br>
<code>qhXpoRtalSboc</code><br>
Now that is something we can work with.<br>
We have a KW and the alpha parts of the fixes.
<p>So far we have only used the ‚ÄúIngredients‚Äù section of the code, let us take a look at the ‚ÄúDirections‚Äù part now.<br>
Notice that in the entire section, there are only 4 numbers?<br>
Write them down, in the order that they appear and in the order that we need them for our passcode format.<br>
<code>9qhX4poRtalSb6o4c</code><br>
There we have it, one freshly prepared passcode!<br>

<p><code><br>
Roman Salad</code></p>
<p><code>5 Radicchio<br>
1 Garden rocket<br>
5 Wasabi<br>
1 Carrot<br>
1 Horseradish<br>
1 Watercress<br>
5 Soybean<br>
1 Arugula<br>
1 Sorrel<br>
1 Papaya de Monte<br>
11 Salsify<br>
1 Jerusalem artichoke</code></p>
<p><code>Mix it all and serve fresh.</code></p>
<p>From the name of this salad, we know what the ingredient counts can be seen as, but where is the rest?</p>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Hint">Hint</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
<p>The <em>name</em> of the salad is a hint at both numbers and letters.</p>
<p></p></div></div>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Solution">Solution</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
<p>Let us get the easy part out of the way first, <strong>Roman</strong> Salad and the fact that we have only 5‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs as ingredient counts, shows us that we‚Äôll need to group them for good numbers.</p>
<p><code>5 1 5 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 11 1</code><br>
<code>V I V I I I V I I I II I</code><br>
Group the Roman Numerals logically<br>
<code>VI VIII VIII III</code><br>
This gives us our 4 numbers that we will need for the final solutions<br>
<code>6 8 8 3</code></p>
<p>Now comes the interesting part, how can we link the <strong>Romans</strong> in another way to what we have in the code?<br>
Have you ever heard of <em>Glycine max</em> or <em>Eruca sativa</em>? No? Me neither until this code came along, but I can almost guarantee you that you have probably eaten them before.<br>
As with most things, you have a common name for something (<em>Soybean</em>) and a scientific name (<em>Glycine max</em>). These scientific names are normally based on the Latin words or names for things and the Romans mostly spoke Latin!</p>
<p>Looking up the <em>accepted</em> scientific/species names for most of the ingredients will give us what we need.<br>
For this, we will mainly use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegetables" target="_blank">List of vegetables</a> on Wikipedia, but you will notice one ingredient is not found there, which is (I believe) the reason why this code remained unsolved for so long.</p>

<p>Two things from this list that made this code live much long than usually:<br>
<strong>*</strong>¬†¬†¬†Even though <em>Wasabia japonica</em> is the species name on that list for Wasabi, the Wikipedia article for it states the species name as <em>Eutrema japonicum</em><br>
<strong>**</strong>¬†¬†This one is probably <strong><em>the</em></strong> reason this code went unsolved for days. Googling for ‚ÄúPapaya de Monte‚Äù will give you a very wide array of apparent scientific names. I found everything from <em><a href="http://www.fruitipedia.com/mountain_papaya.htm" target="_blank">Carica candamarcensis</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/col-de-monte-papaya-tree.htm" target="_blank">Carica monoica</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carica#Species_Previously_in_the_Genus" target="_blank">Vasconcellea monoica</a></em>, all leading to dead ends with the code.<br>
What the correct accepted name eventually was, was <em>Jacaratia digitata (Poepp. &amp; Endl.) Solms-Laub.</em>, found by googling ‚ÄúPapaya de Monte Species Name‚Äù and finding <a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/6fa80ceb5a1b7e77f030d3d4dc0b7b13/common/1d96590a7507844a4b8b368e702db32a" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Taking the first letter of every name, we get the letters that we need for our passcode:<br>
<code>CEWDANGERJTH</code><br>
Combining these with our numbers from earlier, we get to the final solution<br>
<code>6CEW8DANGERJ8T3H</code><br>

First off, if you didn‚Äôt manage to figure out this one, don‚Äôt feel too frustrated, it has a very uncommon step in it.<br>
As suspected, extract all the capital letters from the text<br>
<code>YPMICAEGYONLQYGJOIAZYEJDMAZZCQD</code>
<p>Now comes the uncommon/tricky part and one of us (<a href="https://ingress.codes/author/keyclick/" target="_blank">@keyclick</a>) managed to figure it out after trying many different things.<br>
Rot, Atbash, Vigen√©re, Gronsfeld all gave nothing meaningful, until he started doing his <a href="http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vigenere.php" target="_blank">Vigen√©re</a> steps with common words (which he likes to do when stuck and no other path is visible).<br>
Here he noticed that when he Vig‚Äôed it with the words ‚Äúfive‚Äù and ‚Äúthree‚Äù, readable words came out.</p>
<p>Think back to the previous code, we had a passcode with ‚Äúfive‚Äù in it, but was strangely missing a second number.<br>
You guessed it! Vigen√©re the extracted capital letters with the string of yesterday (before the number substitution)<br>
This fits in with why this recipe seemed only half baked, it was the continuation of the previous code‚Äôs recipe.</p>
<p>So<br>
Input = <code>YPMICAEGYONLQYGJOIAZYEJDMAZZCQD</code><br>
Key = <code>FIVEYDCSTATUEOSEVENBTWOZ</code><br>
Result <code>THREEXCOFOURMKOFTENYFIVEHSEVENB</code></p>
<p>Take the last easy step to whisk up the final solve<br>

Taking a closer look at the ‚ÄúDirections‚Äù section, notice that the capital and lower case letter seem to follow a pattern?<br>
Take capital letters as <code>1</code> and lowercase as <code>0</code>, replace the entire string<br>

Convert Binary to ASCII<br>
<code>4qxb2h7w5r</code>
<p>We only have a prefix and suffix, so we need to find a keyword.<br>
Going back to the name of the recipe and googling it, we find the Portal Wiki article about <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Doug_Rattmann" target="_blank">Doug Rattmann</a>.<br>
First thought might be to use <code>portal</code> as a keyword, but you‚Äôll find that it is invalid.</p>

<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Hint">Hint</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;"><br>
Recipes can be found in Cook<em>books</em> and we are working here with <em>codes</em>.<br>
</div></div>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Solution">Solution</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;"><br>
Whenever you see a lot of text, grouped up in paragraphs and the all number code has a section that never exceeds the number of paragraphs (or lines) in the text, it is generally a good hint at a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cipher" target="_blank">Book Cipher</a></em>
<p>Reading each pair of 3 as &lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;word&gt;&lt;character&gt;, find the characters for each pair<br>
Example:<br>
<code>331</code> = Paragraph 3, word 3, first letter = <code><strong><em>S</em></strong>ugar</code><br>
<code>241</code> = Paragraph 2, word 4, first letter = <code><strong><em>I</em></strong>n</code></p>
<p>The final result should look like this<br>
<code>sixqwrtwochangehsevenmthreey</code><br>
Replacing the written numbers, we get a passcode of<br>
<code>6qwr2changeh7m3y</code></p>
<p>Trying to redeem that code will result in ‚ÄúInvalid Passcode.‚Äù due to an error in the original numbers.<br>
It happens and sometimes can be frustrating, but luckily this one was solved relatively quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://ingress.codes/author/wapta/" target="_blank">@Wapta</a> was determined not to let the code go unsolved, so he brute forced the numbers and found the error in the second <code>414</code> number.<br>
It should be <code>424</code>, resulting in a text of<br>
<code>sixqwrtwochangensevenmthreey</code><br>
and final solve of<br>
<code>6qwr2changen7m3y</code><br>
