<h1>Code #1</h1>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>1-3 of the same number, letter, 1-3 of the same number, letter and the pattern continues.</p>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Hint">Hint</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
<p>Maybe there is more than 1 passcode hidden in this code.</p>

<p>Most Investigate Ingress posts have 3 codes hidden in them and it isn’t uncommon for single codes to have multiple passcodes hidden inside.  <code>[2]</code> is too short to easily have 2 passcodes inside and this code has more than enough space to hide an extra passcode.  Then all we need to know is which information is used for which code.  Because the numbers are repeated there is a strong possibility that each group of numbers is part of the same code, so to start try only splits that keep those groups together.  The first obvious one would just be numbers and letters.<br>
<code>[1a] 666 8 66 55 2 22 8 22 8 55 8 666 5 111 5 66 2 22 8 6</code><br>
<code>[1b] twrhaforcrsngniafoo</code><br>
We will start with <code>[1b]</code>.<br>
This is what gives us a good indication that our split was correct.  Converting letter pairs to numbers make something very close to a code, only the keyword appears to be messed up.<br>
<code>2rha4rcrsng9a4o</code><br>
Google is giving us nothing good so maybe we are missing something.  Taking another look at the keyword <code>rcrsn</code> it only has common consonants.  What if all the vowels were just taken out of the keyword?  Looking through a keyword list there is a keyword that fits.<br>
<code>2rha4recursiong9a4o</code><br>
Now for <code>[1a]</code>.<br>
At first the <code>[1a]</code> code looks like a phone cipher but 111 messes that up.  The numbers are always limited to triples so maybe the number of repeats minus 1 could be added before the number to get numbers 0-25 or 1-26, no luck there either.  How about keyboard, number of repeats it the row and the number itself is the column.  Bingo.<br>

<h1>Code #2</h1>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>15 letters and numbers but the amount of each doesn’t fit with standard code format.</p>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Hint">Hint</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
<p>Does it really matter if there are too many numbers?</p>
<p></p></div></div>
<div class="spoiler-wrap"><div class="spoiler-head collapsed" title="Solution">Solution</div><div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
<p>Ignore that there are too many numbers for standard code format and organize the code into 5 rows.<br>
<code>4mw<br>
cs9<br>
j4e<br>
q09<br>
38b</code><br>
Reading down from top left we get:<br>
<code>4cjq3ms408w9e9b</code><br>
Which is in proper code format with an invalid keyword.  With a quick google search of <code>ms408</code> we are lead to something called the Voynich Manuscript, Voynich is a known keyword.<br>
<code>4cjq3voynichw9e9b</code></p>
